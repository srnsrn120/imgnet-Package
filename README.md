## About Imgnet

Imgnet is a deep learning image classification library written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.Keras. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation of images classification. You can classify any image with any classification model in Keras appliaction without writing any lines of code.


Imgnet is:

- **Simple** -- Imgnet reduces developer time of writing too much code of any image classification problem so that they focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
- **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of *progressive disclosure of complexity*: simple workflows should be quick and easy that’s why Imgnet is Flexible.
- **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: so we can use Imgnet in the production

## Keras & Imgnet 

Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface
for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. We can do so many tasks using Keras and image classification is one of them, but the issue is like we need to write many lines of code to implement an image classification solution.

But in Imgnet you don’t need to write many lines of code for implementing an image classification solution. You don’t also have to worry about your data preparation. What you need to do is just have to define your data path & some of the parameters of the model yes, your work will be done!
